# Default strict CSP from https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/CspFilter#Default-CSP-Policy

#
# Migration from contentSecurityPolicy in 2.7.x https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.7.x/CspFilter#Deprecation-of-SecurityHeaders.contentSecurityPolicy
#
# unsafe-inline is still included as there are <script> tags in the HTML markup for the timeout dialog, this can be extracted out to an external JS file and then included
# Inline javascript functions such as onClick="window.print()" moved to external script https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/adopting-csp.html#refactor-inline-event-handlers-and-javascript-uris
# a nonce has been added to ensure only external scripts from our service are executed as per the directive below
# On hold due to still using assets-frontend, can move to CSP when moving to play-frontend-hmrc
